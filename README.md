# Project: Language Translation
## My 4th Project in the Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/language-translation

### Project Overview
In this project, I took a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. I trained a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code in the jupyter notebook you also need the file [**helper.py**](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/language-translation/helper.py) and [**problem_unittests.py**](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/language-translation/problem_unittests.py) as well as the [small vocabulary dataset](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/language-translation/data) from the [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/language-translation).

Load the file with jupyter notebook using the following command:

```jupyter notebook dlnd_language_translation.ipynb```
